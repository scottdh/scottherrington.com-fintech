              I led a research and design process, supported by a talented team
              of UI, dev and QA colleagues in London and Krakow. Our efforts led
              to the discovery of valuable user insights, numerous user
              experience improvements, and a validated long-term design
              direction for the future development of all IG's mobile trading
              platforms.

              <li>
                <strong>Existing value was unlocked</strong>, by revamping the
                IA and navigation to really focus on the needs of traders while
                completing key tasks. This IA tested so well with clients it has
                become the template for all IG's trading platforms, and laid the
                foundation for a more cohesive experience upon which to build
                future functionality going forward.

                >
                thanks to the introduction of new interaction patterns and the
                addition of more supportive, less ambiguous information at key
                decision points.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>A new approach to discovery was validated.</strong>
                'Dumb lists' were replaced with smarter, context rich
                collections, organised in a way that traders found useful and
                engaging. This has resulted in a whole new product category,
                aimed at more proactively helping traders research and find
                opportunities.

                >
                thanks to a cross-platform approach from the very beginning
                that's resulted in UX and UI that scales across platforms while
                respecting mobile OS idiosyncrasies.

            <p>
              The eagerly awaited 2015 annual Investment Trends Report had
              arrived. For the first time ever, IG's flagship app had slipped
              from the top spot... to third. IG had invested heavily in their
              apps the previous two years, making them by far the most
              feature-packed on the market, but this 'more is more' approach
              obviously wasn't resonating with clients.
            </p>
            <p>
              With competition increasing and mobile trading becoming ever more
              important to clients, a serious strategic rethink was needed.
            </p>

            <h3>Objectives</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Identify</strong> why IG's apps are losing ground to
                competitors and better understand what traders are looking for
                in a mobile trading experience.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Propose</strong> a validated set of forward-looking
                designs and prototypes that will inform how IG's trading apps
                should evolve over the next 18-24 months.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Align</strong> the mobile apps with the visual identity
                forged by the recently released desktop trading app, to aid a
                consistent multi-platform trading experience.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2 id="benchmark">Benchmark and Iterate</h2>
            <p>
              The first task was to begin benchmarking the current design and
              user experience, so we'd have something to measure proposed
              improvements against. To do this, I first carried out a thorough
              heuristic evaluation of the apps. The framework I hung my work on
              was David Travis'
              <a
                href="https://www.userfocus.co.uk/articles/redroutes.html"
                class="linkText"
                target="_blank"
                >Red Route model</a
              >
              , which defines a key task as one that's
              <strong
                >completed by all users, is high frequency, and is critical for
                both users and the business</strong
              >. It's straight-forward, and I find it great for getting
              user-centric, and naturally more business-centric stakeholders
              positively engaged with the process. Which is half the battle in
              design.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The Red Route tasks we identified, and confirmed with research
              were:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Find a trading opportunity</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Create or edit an order</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Monitor positions</strong></li>
            </ol>
            <br />
            <p>
              Having completed the evaluation, a few concerning conclusions
              stuck out.
            </p>
            <p>
              Firstly, all three tasks were hindered by an inefficient feature,
              rather than task, oriented IA. This meant valuable functionality
              and features that aided a common task were often inaccessible from
              one another.
            </p>
            <p>
              Secondly, creating an order, perhaps the most critical task in the
              app was far from optimised, or supportive of the task. Accessing
              the ticket often required several stages of navigation. Completing
              the ticket was not especially intuitive, contained ambiguous data,
              required more manual steps than necessary, and did not support
              differing client mental models and trading strategies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, iOS and Android looked and felt like they were built by
              different companies. Navigation, task-flows, UI and even labels
              were inconsistent. This, meant scaling optimal solutions for both
              would be impossible in the current state.
            </p>
            <p>
              This last point I began tackling straight off the bat with
              developers by creating an OS specific style-guide and component
              library for both platforms. Though this didn't address the major
              problems and inconsistencies, as that would require more
              fundamental changes and a more robust research approach, it did
              improve UI consistency and overall aesthetics of the apps. This
              gave us a better foundation, on which to gradually make those more
              fundamental changes.

                To begin addressing the numerous UI inconsistencies I created a

                components.

            <h3>Stakeholder Interviews</h3>
            <p>
              With the initial evaluation complete, I began talking with
              stakeholders around the business. My main aim was to understand
              the perspectives and objectives different areas of the business
              had for the apps, and learn about any current concerns, future
              hopes or existing ideas that'd influence the design going forward.
              To do this, I conducted semi-structured interviews with members of
              the Trading Services team (front-line client support) and various
              heads of departments.
            </p>
            <p>
              It became clear that some of my concerns were shared by trading
              services, but those concerns were played down by major
              stakeholders. Their focus was on building new things. Even
              acknowledging existing problems was problematic in fact -
              particularly with the order ticket. They didn't have any problem
              themselves after all. Clearly some work had do be done.
            </p>

            <h3>Qualitative Research</h3>
            <p>
              Feeling well oriented, it was time to begin tackling the more
              robust research tasks that would help me form hypotheses, which
              would form the foundation of the design process later on.
            </p>

            <p>The main questions I wanted to answer were:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>How do traders find trading opportunities?</strong> What
                sources do they use, which data points are most important and
                which tools do they love?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>How do traders go about creating orders?</strong> What
                factors are they weighing up, what informs trade sizes, how are
                they managing risk and what difficulties do they have
                translating strategy and intention to input?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>How do traders monitor their accounts</strong> when
                they've "skin in the game"? How frequently do they check, what
                tools do they use and what frustrations have they faced in the
                pursuit of maximising profits and minimising losses?
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              To answer these questions, 3 main methods were used.
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>User interviews</strong>, in which I spent up to 90
                minutes with clients who frequently trade on mobile. This was a
                mixture of semi-structred interviews and having the clients
                demonstrate how they complete tasks currently.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Watching usability testing</strong> of the recently
                launched desktop app. Though this didn't highlight mobile
                specific problems, it was very valuable in understanding how
                traders thought, where their priorities lay and their
                behaviours.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Focus groups</strong>, as suggested by the research
                team. Despite the drawbacks of teasing insights from
                group-settings, focus groups aren't to be entirely dismissed if
                not used in isolation. They're useful primarily for identifying
                avenues of further research and a convenient opportunity to
                expose a team to clients in real time. So I helped the research
                team prepare this.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Quantitative Research</h3>
            <p>
              In parallel, I spent a lot of time getting data from B.I.
              (Business Intelligence, a data analysis tool), Trading Services
              support emails and whatever analytics the mobile teams could give
              me. This uncovered some nuggets of info that informed new design
              directions, or entirely new avenues.
            </p>
            <p>
              One nugget was the highly frequent, but very short session times
              of 1-10 seconds. We hypothesised that traders were checking
              position and account balance information, because no navigation
              took place. This prompted us to investigate ways of surfacing this
              information outside of the apps, so traders could glean this with
              faster and with much less effort.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another nugget was the discrepancy between the number of markets a
              trader might have in a watchlist, compared to the number they
              would trade. Currently, markets in watchlists and positions had
              exactly the same size and data density. Clearly we could look into
              making more optimised views for positions, considering the fact
              significantly fewer would ever be on the screen at the same time.
            </p>
            <figure style="width: 100%; padding: 3em 0; text-align: center">

                style="width: 100%; "

            </figure>
            <p>
              Once we'd sorted, categorised and analysed the data, we had a
              wealth of insights and research deliverables to work with. The
              outcomes included a set of trader personas/archetypes detailing
              characteristics to design for, and numerous hypothoses to begin
              exploring.

              If we are not only to "get the right design" but also "get the
              design right" when implemented, building shared understanding of
              the project's goals, user insights, and plan of action is
              essential.
            </p>
            <p>
              I planned and facilitated workshops with the mobile development
              teams in both London (iOS) and Krakow (Android). I and the
              researchers shared all insights and conclusions from the research
              process, which generated great, in-depth discussions. The product
              team members could begin taking an informed and active role in the
              design process from then on. We then discussed the Red Routes and
              how we would collaborate on the next steps.

              <strong>Insight.</strong> Involving the rest of the mobile product
              teams only once much of the research had already been conducted
              isn't my preferred way of working. Far from it, but despite the
              PO's understanding for whole team involvement, the prevailing
              project-management culture was against us. You have to pick your
              battles, and this was a compromise.

            <p>
              With a good amount of research, and everyone on the same page, it
              was time to roll up our sleeves. The aim was to explore and
              validate the hypotheses formed in step 3 for each of the Red
              Routes. We wanted to produce a good-quality, thorough prototype
              for Premium client testing, which would help uncover new insights
              and inform iterative improvements... or total rethinks.
            </p>

            <p>
              For each of the red routes, I and the mobile lead UI designer
              conducted semi-structured design sprints. Though we unfortunately
              weren't able to involve the rest of the mobile product teams' as
              much as we would have liked 'officially' (due to other running
              project commitments) we did involve them at every opportunity. We
              even went so far as to fix time outside of work hours to discuss
              design with the wider team. This is how imporant I believe
              developer and QA involvement in design is, even if that's not
              supported by official processes. The fact my team members agreed
              is testament to their commitment, and further proof there's an
              intrinsic motivation to collaborate at this level.
            </p>

            <p>
              One major obstacle we had in this process was the same one shared
              by anyone designing in niche markets - access to clients for
              usability testing. This reality meant usability testing with real
              target clients was saved until we had explored all 3 sprints.
            </p>

            <p>
              To help mitigate the issues that arise when you don't have the
              ability to frequently check assumptions, we turned to colleagues
              from around the business, particularly Trading Services team
              members. These colleagues are often active traders themselves, and
              they have first hand experience with clients day in day out.
              Though they'd have different biases, or be blind to certain
              IG-centric things such as terminology that could cause problems,
              their experience and intuition helped a lot. It's not perfect, but
              this definitely helped improve the design.
            </p>

            <h3>The steps for redesigning and prototyping each task</h3>

            <p>
              <strong>1. Map the problem.</strong> We mapped out the task, to
              clearly show the beginning and end points for each, and any
              interstitial steps we knew needed to be included. Often there were
              multiple possible start and end points, depending on the type of
              trader. For example, the way chartists identify opportunities and
              place trades is quite different from the flow a fundamental trader
              would follow.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>2. Gather relevant data, insights and hypotheses.</strong>
              We walked through each step of the problem and attached all the
              insights we had for that step. This might be data insights,
              usability test observations, or trader characteristics - like
              mental models certain types of traders were assessing tasks with.
              This would help us go over the designs, as we reviewed each
              iteration's ability to solve or improve problems. More
              importantly, it would help others' see the inputs we had, and with
              their perspectives, help us improve, or cover our blind-spots.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>3. Sketch and review.</strong> We sketched out ideas and I
              began drafting them up into wire-flows. These are low fidelity,
              easily changeable depictions of each screen involved in a task,
              showing interactions within each, and between each screen. I would
              add notes to the screens too, pointing out problems I was facing,
              or justifications for any design decisions I had made. This work
              was frequently reviewed by design colleagues during design crits,
              and by trading services.

            <p>
              <strong>4. Prototyping.</strong> Together with the UI designer we
              took the wire-flows and went slightly higher fidelity in Framer.
              This allowed us to sense check the data and layouts in the
              wireframes, and ensure each responded well to different device
              sizes - including tablet. If these basic things break down, we
              catch them early. Once we were happy, we plumbed in some real data
              from IG's API which really tested the layout, as we got real
              market names and prices in place.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>
              <strong>5. Testing.</strong> Throughout the sketch and prototyping
              process, I identified the hypotheses that posed the most risk to
              the overall design - which included new navigation patterns that
              if failed, would undermine many other experiments. For this
              reason, we ensured we got concrete validations of these first. I
              worked closely with our internal researcher to script, record and
              evaluate each of the 15 sessions we had scheduled face-to-face
              with existing premium clients, and prospects.
            </p>

            <p>
              Obviously the results from just 15 clients isn't the most robust
              of findings to pin major redesign decision on. So, once we were
              confident we had validated certain design approaches as best we
              could, I found a low risk approach to testing them in production
              with a larger number of traders. I introduced them to our mobile
              web apps. These have a much smaller user base, so I used them as a
              test bed, supported by the design teams and POs of our web apps.
              Being web-based, it meant we could release changes to gradually
              increasing numbers, and roll back if we spotted problems, far
              quicker. We tracked user behaviour and feedback, and found the
              designs held up.

            />

            <p class="asideNote learning">
              That said, problems did become apparent. In some areas we'd pushed
              the design too far, to the point some steps within a task became
              unfamiliar. Fortunately, the potential adjustments were numerous
              and we were confident it was just a case of iterating, rather than
              concern for the entire direction.

              It was a huge amount of work, but extremely rewarding. Some of the
              bigger bets really paid off, risky patterns proved far less
              worrisome that worst case scenarios imagined, and clients reacted
              very positively to ideas in the prototype - despite it being in a
              very early phase.
            </p>
            <p>
              We ended with incredibly valuable insights which validated some
              hypotheses, and totally invalidated others. The side effect of
              this approach was also a more tight-knit, more informed and
              empathetic mobile product team enthused about the upcoming work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the coming weeks we iterated on these ideas, and folded
              testing into other research initiatives. The results of which were
              introduced towards the beginning of this case study.
