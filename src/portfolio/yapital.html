              Yapital was the world's first cross-channel mobile payment app,
              allowing customers to pay online, in-store, via invoice and from
              street posters, all via QR-code. I introduced user-centric design
              practices, which led to a number of successes and product
              breakthroughs.

            <p>
              Yapital had worked on its mobile payment solution for over a year
              before I joined. Unfortunately, at no point did the product teams
              test the technology or designs with prospective clients. And it
              showed. When they triumphantly went live, a whole host of problems
              began rearing their ugly heads. For me, it was quite the baptism
              of fire, but witnessing the amazing successes and cataclysmic
              errors of this enthusiastic Hamburg based start-up I learnt so, so
              much. The following gives some insight into the projects I worked
              on, my approach and learnings.

            <p>
              Mobile payment was still the stuff of sci-fi back in 2012. It was
              no wonder then, that upon launch of their mobile payment app, the
              benefits of QR-code based mobile payments was viewed with
              skepticism, caution and even disbelief. The design of the apps,
              marketing and onboarding showed little awareness, let alone
              competence in assuaging the perceptions held by their target
              audience. On top of this, the product and service was riddled with
              problems caused by a complete lack of customer awareness and
              unchecked biases.
            </p>
            <h3>The Brief</h3>
            <p>
              Introduce user-centred design (UCD) to Yapital, and work with the
              company's product teams in Hamburg and Kiev to integrate UCD
              practices into their product development cycle.
            </p>
            <h3>The Process</h3>
            <p>
              I decided to use persona research and formation as a visible
              ‘entry strategy’. It's an approach that can be quite engaging, and
              my hope was that this very visual, collaborative exercise would
              begin raising awareness and enthusiasm.
            </p>
            <h3>Kick-Off presentation at company meeting</h3>
            <p>
              UCD is not just a design framework, it’s a mentality that needs to
              be widely adopted. I decided make it as participatory as possible,
              to improve buy-in, and because I simply couldn’t do it alone. To
              raise awareness I presented UCD and benefits at a company meeting.
              This was received very well.

            <h3>Colleague Recruitment</h3>
            <p>
              I began recruiting those colleagues whom I thought would be
              effective 'change agents' from different departments to help.
              Management support from each department certainly made this
              process a lot easier. This was the ‘core’ team.
            </p>
            <h3>User Research</h3>
            <p>
              I started simply, by creating a basic interview script which could
              be used by my recruited colleagues to carry out discovery
              interviews with family, friends and acquaintances who fit our
              defined user segments. The questions were quite basic, and I
              offered a few tips, and demonstrated an interview through
              role-play.
            </p>
            <p>
              1 month later we had 20 recorded interviews, of reasonable quality
              and depth. As the interviews were codified and analysed, insights
              were being informally fed back through the departments by
              colleagues. Which was extremely exciting to see.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the personas were fleshed out, with the aid of secondary
              market research, we officially introduced the 3 consumer personas
              and 2 merchant personas to all our colleagues, which are now being
              used during design processes and prioritisation meetings.

            <h2 id="diaryStudy">A Nation-Wide Diary Study</h2>
            <p>
              Nobody in the world had yet paid at a brick 'n' mortar store's
              point of sale (POS) using a mobile phone. When trialling our
              payment service at Germany's biggest supermarket chain REWE, we
              found that staff were nervous, and Yapital customers were
              experiencing everything from childish excitement to utter
              embarassment.
            </p>
            <h3>The brief</h3>
            <p>
              In partnership with REWE, we were tasked with gathering insights
              into Yapital’s User Experience, with REWE’s POS as focus point.
            </p>
            <h3>The Process</h3>
            <p>
              To meet the expectations of our partners, and ensure the process
              was as fruitful as possible for both parties, we decided to carry
              out a nation-wide diary study, using an online platform, so that
              both Yapital and REWE could monitor the process and input from
              participants.
            </p>
            <p>
              30 participants from all around Germany were recruited to take
              part, careful to ensure a representative sample, with regards to
              sex, city of residence, age and operating systems used.
            </p>
            <p>
              The participants were set tasks over the course of three weeks.
              These were:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Inform yourself about Yapital using their website.</li>
              <li>Onboard with Yapital (browser or app)</li>
              <li>
                Complete two purchases, on two separate days with Yapital at a
                REWE supermarket of your choice
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Throughout the study, participants diligently completed the tasks
              and were surprisingly active on the forum, where we posed
              questions related to the tasks.
            </p>
            <h3>The Results</h3>
            <p>
              Needless to say, the 76 page report as a result of this 3 week
              process was an absolute goldmine, with regards to user experience
              insights. Though a number of concerns were brought to our
              attention, or confirmed, the overall feedback gave us good reason
              to believe that mobile payment was a future people were excited
              by, and with the right design approach could be successfuly
              adopted.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, much of the results are still covered by a
              Non-Disclosure Agreement.

            <h2 id="instoreTill">In-store till payments</h2>
            <h3>The Brief</h3>
            <p>
              I was asked to investigate if it was possible to remove the
              confirmation screen at in-store POS without adversely affecting
              the user-experience. This could significantly increase the speed
              of payment, but initial thoughts was that it was risky, as it
              provided reassurance and consistency with other payment flows.
            </p>
            <h3>The Approach</h3>
            <p>
              It was important to ensure that changing the user-flow at POS
              wouldn’t adversely affect people’s expectations in other
              user-flows, where the confirmation screen would be very necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
              To test this I planned to test with 2 groups of shoppers. One
              would go through the checkout procedure without the confirmation
              screen first, followed by an invoice payment with the confirmation
              screen. The other group was reversed.
            </p>
            <p>
              The test took place ‘guerilla style’ at a local supermarket. As I
              got volunteers, I introduced Yapital, explained the test and asked
              them how they would expect the payment process to function before
              both tests. With a keynote prototype the volunteers did a
              mock-payment, which gave an excellent impression of the real
              user-flow.
            </p>
            <p>
              I then compared the reactions of both groups when the confirmation
              screen was left-out. Those who did an invoice payment first, and
              therefore were aware of the confirmation step, were not confused
              or worried when this step did not show up at POS. In fact neither
              group in pre interview expected a confirmation step. The flow was
              simply compared 1:1 with a card payment - and card payments due to
              having no UI cannot add this step.
            </p>
            <h3>The Results</h3>
            <p>
              We removed the confirmation screen for POS transactions without a
              single complaint. Checkout time decreased thanks to both human and
              system factors. Our supermarket partners were thrilled because now
              Yapital payments could consistently beat card payments for speed.
            </p>
            <p>
              This speed improvement increased REWE's, trust decreased their
              skepticism, and directly led to their decision to roll out Yapital
              at more stores as part of a nation-wide trial.
            </p>

            <h2 id="cashingUp">Cashing up</h2>
            <h3>The Brief</h3>
            <p>
              Early feedback from our merchants revealed that cashing-up at
              night was a pain, because to get the day’s revenue they had use
              their computer, which was often far away from other traditional
              till equipment. Instead, they wanted a way to quickly and easily
              do this via the app.
            </p>
            <h3>The Approach</h3>
            <p>
              I contacted a few of our smaller merchants in Hamburg and invited
              myself to their place of business, to observe their cashing-up
              procedures. I made notes of which information they required from
              till receipts, how it was noted, and how end-of-shift calculations
              were made.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though Yapital is an electronic-money solution, with no
              traditional clearing processes, the merchant’s mental models were
              still very much based around traditional cash-registers. I made a
              note of the terminology they used when referring to the reports.
            </p>
            <p>
              I called Business Analysts, Devs and Design colleagues together. I
              presented my research, shared quotes and prioritised the
              information needs. 2 hours later we had a complete paper-prototype
              which fulfilled our initial requirements. A couple of hours after
              that I had a click-dummy made up in Balsmiq that our devs were
              happy with.
            </p>
            <p>
              I loaded this onto an iPad and I user-tested it with our merchants
              that week, informally, at their place of work. It was simple, but
              the task success rate was 100% with all 7 merchants.
            </p>
            <h3>The Results</h3>
            <p>
              Within just one sprint, our iOs and Android app developers were
              able to implement the designs. This was largely because they'd
              been a part of the design process and had a good understanding of
              the problem and solution. Once we had updated the merchant app
              with the new cashing-up functionality the feedback was brilliant.
              All it took was an understanding of existing mental models and
              processes shared by smaller merchants and a collaborative design
              process over the space of just a few days.
