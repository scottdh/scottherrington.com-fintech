        <p>
          Scott’s been into tech since his Grandad shoved a Commodore Amiga
          keyboard and mouse into his chubby little hands aged three. Now, as a
          UX designer with over 7 years experience at Fintech companies in
          Germany and the UK, he’s helped product teams design award winning
          apps for payments, banking, investments and retail trading. When not
          designing, he’s thinking up novel ways to improve designer and dev
          collaboration, to improve user understanding and products… all while
          having a tonne of fun in the process.
