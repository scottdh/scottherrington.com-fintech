              Nadex is the world's first provider of exchange traded binary
              options. With Apple and Google announcing an imminent ban on all
              binaries trading apps, I led the design efforts of the company's
              first mobile PWA - helping safeguard around half the company's
              revenue within weeks.

                It was a pleasure. The speed at which you worked, and the
                transparency of the process was something we're not used to. We
                felt listened to, and in these few weeks the team's achieved
                more than in the last 2 years it feels like. It felt exciting to

              Apple's App Store let slip its intention to ban all apps that
              facilitated the trading of Binary Options, and there was a concern
              this ban may be adopted by Google's Play Store too. Nadex
              specialises in exchange traded binary options, with these making
              up almost 90% of all trades on their platform. Half of these
              trades are made through their iOS and Android apps.
            </p>

            <p>
              Though Nadex is a US regulated finance company, and the pricing of
              their products is completely transparent, thanks to the nature of
              an open exchange, Apple and Google were taking a sledge hammer
              approach in their attempt to protect consumers affected by
              unscrupulous, unregulated operators in this space. Such a ban
              would have a massive affect on Nadex's revenue and growth
              prospects, and these affects needed to mitigated immediately.

              An emergency meeting was called by the executive team, with
              members from the entire chain of design and web development
              present.

              We were tasked with designing and building Nadex's first mobile
              browser trading platform, to protect the significant revenue that
              would be lost, once the apps were removed from their respective
              stores. As we had no idea when Apple or Google would remove the
              apps, we worked with the assumption it would happen tomorrow.

              My job as lead UX designer on the project was to very quickly:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Engage with stakeholders in Chicago to get their design input,
                and to reassure them with tangible progress.
              </li>
              <li>
                Work with everyone in the team to map the tasks, create shared
                understanding and identify potential problems.
              </li>
              <li>
                Identify key user tasks we needed to support, and devise a
                framework for prioritising the support of these tasks. This
                would become the basis for our iterative release plan.
              </li>
              <li>
                Work with the team to conceive a feasible design and strategy
                that would enable us to build and release an MVP (as defined by
                us), and iterate on this frequently.
              </li>
            </ul>

                I gained support for Nadex's first ever Design Sprint. It's
                collaborative nature, emphasis on speed in reaching shared
                understanding and the creation of tangible deliverables would be
                advantageous for evaluating our work quickly, and reassuring
                stakeholders.
              </li>
              <li>
                I planned the sprint and devised the 5 day schedule. Our PO
                blocked out time in the diaries of our team and stakeholders. A
                software architect, front-end dev, QA, UI, UX (me) and Tech Lead
                and PO made up the core team.
              </li>
              <li>
                I facilitated each day of the design sprint, while contributing
                to the tasks, and kept our stakeholders in Chicago and London in
                the loop. This not only really reassured them, but they became
                really engaged with the process. It was not only a very pleasant
                surprise, but had a hugely positive impact on our designs.
              </li>
              <li>
                Together with our UI designer we created medium fidelity,
                testable prototypes of the outcomes from our collaborative
                sketch and decision making sessions with the rest of the team.
                This ability totally freed up our developers to concentrate on
                preparing the back end.
              </li>
              <li>
                We presented the prototype for an MVP which everyone in the team
                had had a hand in influencing, and demonstrated exactly how we
                planned to get there taking into account key user tasks in
                priority order and development concerns. An unforeseen bonus was
                that our developers were able to demo a production ready
                end-to-end code, allowing a Nadex trader to login and see a
                position and their balances.
              </li>
              <li>
                I worked with our user researcher and developed a test script so
                that our prototype could be tested with a number of existing
                Nadex traders. Client testing started just 12 days into our
                project.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section>
          <div class="content">
            <h2 id="theResults">The Results</h2>
            <p>
              Within 3.5 weeks we designed and built a regulatory compliant,
              tested MVP of our Nadex PWA, which could have been released if
              necessary. This enabled traders to view their open positions, view
              their account balances and reduce their exposure on the go.
            </p>
            <p>
              Within just an additional 3 weeks, traders were able to view a
              list of predetermined markets, and open new positions. These
              markets represented around 80% of those traded, and therefore
              meant Nadex had a feasible alternative to their native apps for a
              significant proportion of their revenue.
            </p>
            <p>
              A group of people who had never worked together became a team,
              showing trust, support and will to achieve the goal within an
              extremely short space of time
            </p>
            <p>
              The prototype was tested and validated a number of design
              decisions, and showed that IA/navigation changes led to certain
              user tasks performing better than our native apps.
